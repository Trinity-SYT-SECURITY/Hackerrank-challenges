
**Objective**

Today, we will learn about the Array data structure. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video.

**Task**

Given an array, `A`, of `N` integers, print `A`'s elements in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

**Example**

A = [1,2,3,4]

Print `4 3 2 1`. Each integer is separated by one space.

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer, `N` (the size of our array).
The second line contains `N` space-separated integers that describe array `A`'s elements.


**Constraints**
+ 1 <= N <= 1000
+ 1 <= A[i] <= 10000 , where A[i] is the `i^th` integer in the array.

**Output Format**

Print the elements of array `A` in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

**Sample Input**

```
4
1 4 3 2
```

**Sample Output**

`2 3 4 1`
